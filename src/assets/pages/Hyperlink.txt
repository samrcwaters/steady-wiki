In computing, a Hyperlink, or simply a link, is a reference to data that the
reader can directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering.

A Hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document.

Hypertext is text with hyperlinks.

The term was coined by Ted Nelson at the start of Project Xanadu.
