Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices
with references (Hyperlink) to other text that the reader can immediately access.

Hypertext documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click,
keypress set or by touching the screen.

The term Hypertext was coined by Ted Nelson at the start of Project Xanadu.

A Wiki uses Hyperlink and Hypertext to connect data.
